                <p>When we think of famine, we often think of a lack of food. But increasingly, the crisis is one not
                    only of food insecurity, but also of clean water, sanitation and health care â€“ especially disease
                    prevention and treatment.

                    the villages with livestock. Here, we came across to mitigate the basic needs. We are heading

                    but the right nutrition and medicine at the right time can also help change lives and break the
                    cycle of poverty</p>
